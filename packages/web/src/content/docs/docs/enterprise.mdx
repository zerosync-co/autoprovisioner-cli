description: Using opencode in your organization.
---

opencode does not store any of your code or context data. This makes it easy for
you to use opencode at your organization.

To get started, we recommend:

1. Do a trial internally with your team.
2. [**Contact us**](mailto:hello@sst.dev) to discuss pricing and implementation options.

---

## Trial

Since opencode is open source and does not store any of your code or context data, your developers can simply [get started](/docs/) and carry out a trial.

---

### Data handling

**opencode does not store your code or context data.** All processing happens locally or through direct API calls to your AI provider.

The only caveat here is the optional `/share` feature that must be manually enabled.

---

#### Sharing conversations

If a user enables the `/share` feature, the conversation and the data associated with it are sent to the service we use to host these shares pages at opencode.ai.

The data is currently served through our CDN's edge network, and is cached on the edge near your users.

---

### Code ownership

**You own all code produced by opencode.** There are no licensing restrictions or ownership claims.

---

## Deployment

Once you have completed your trial and you are ready to self-host opencode at
your organization, you can [**contact us**](mailto:hello@sst.dev) to discuss
pricing and implementation options.

---

### SSO

SSO integration can be implemented for enterprise deployments after your trial. Currently users manage and configure individual API keys locally.

This can be switched to a centralized authentication system that your organization uses.

---

### Self-hosting

The share feature can be self-hosted and the share pages can be made accessible
only after the user has been authenticated.
