To debug any issues with autoprovisioner, you can check the logs or the session data
that it stores locally.

---

### Logs

Log files are written to:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/autoprovisioner/log/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\autoprovisioner\log\`

Log files are named with timestamps (e.g., `2025-01-09T123456.log`) and the most recent 10 log files are kept.

You can configure the log level in your [config file](/docs/config#logging) to get more detailed debug information.

---

### Storage

autoprovisioner stores session data and other application data on disk at:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/autoprovisioner/`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\autoprovisioner`

This directory contains:

- `auth.json` - Authentication data like API keys, OAuth tokens
- `log/` - Application logs
- `project/` - Project-specific data like session and message data
  - If the project is within a Git repo, it is stored in `./<project-slug>/storage/`
  - If it is not a Git repo, it is stored in `./global/storage/`

## Getting help

If you're experiencing issues with autoprovisioner:

1. **Report issues on GitHub**

   The best way to report bugs or request features is through our GitHub repository:

   [**github.com/zerosync-co/autoprovisioner/issues**](https://github.com/zerosync-co/autoprovisioner/issues)

   Before creating a new issue, search existing issues to see if your problem has already been reported.

## Common issues

Here are some common issues and how to resolve them.

---

### autoprovisioner won't start

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Try running with `--print-logs` to see output in the terminal
3. Ensure you have the latest version with `autoprovisioner upgrade`

---

### Authentication issues

1. Try re-authenticating with `autoprovisioner auth login <provider>`
2. Check that your API keys are valid
3. Ensure your network allows connections to the provider's API

---

### Model not available

1. Check that you've authenticated with the provider
2. Verify the model name in your config is correct
3. Some models may require specific access or subscriptions

### Copy/paste not working on Linux

Linux users need to have one of the following clipboard utilities installed for copy/paste functionality to work:

**For X11 systems:**

```bash
apt install -y xclip
# or
apt install -y xsel
```

**For Wayland systems:**

```bash
apt install -y wl-clipboard
```

**For headless environments:**

```bash
apt install -y xvfb
# and run:
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
export DISPLAY=:99.0
```

autoprovisioner will detect if you're using Wayland and prefer `wl-clipboard`, otherwise it will try to find clipboard tools in order of: `xclip` and `xsel`.

---

### How to select and copy text in the TUI

There are several ways to copy text from autoprovisioner's TUI:

- **Copy latest message**: Use `<leader>y` to copy the most recent message in your current session to the clipboard
- **Export session**: Use `/export` (or `<leader>x`) to open the current session as plain text in your `$EDITOR` (requires the `EDITOR` environment variable to be set)

We're working on adding click & drag text selection in a future update.

---

### TUI not rendering full width

By default, autoprovisioner's TUI uses an "auto" layout that centers content with padding. If you want the TUI to use the full width of your terminal, you can configure the layout setting:

```json title="autoprovisioner.json"
{
  "layout": "stretch"
}
```

Read more about this in the [config docs](/docs/config#layout).
