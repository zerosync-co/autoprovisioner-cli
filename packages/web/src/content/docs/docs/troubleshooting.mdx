To debug any issues with opencode, you can check the logs or the session data
that it stores locally.

---

### Logs

Log files are written to:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/opencode/log/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\opencode\log\`

Log files are named with timestamps (e.g., `2025-01-09T123456.log`) and the most recent 10 log files are kept.

You can configure the log level in your [config file](/docs/config#logging) to get more detailed debug information.

---

### Storage

opencode stores session data and other application data on disk at:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/opencode/`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\opencode`

This directory contains:

- `auth.json` - Authentication data like API keys, OAuth tokens
- `log/` - Application logs
- `project/` - Project-specific data like session and message data
  - If the project is within a Git repo, it is stored in `./<project-slug>/storage/`
  - If it is not a Git repo, it is stored in `./global/storage/`

## Common issues

Here are some common issues and how to resolve them.

---

### opencode won't start

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Try running with `--print-logs` to see output in the terminal
3. Ensure you have the latest version with `opencode upgrade`

---

### Authentication issues

1. Try re-authenticating with `opencode auth login <provider>`
2. Check that your API keys are valid
3. Ensure your network allows connections to the provider's API

---

### Model not available

1. Check that you've authenticated with the provider
2. Verify the model name in your config is correct
3. Some models may require specific access or subscriptions

### Copy/paste not working on Linux

Linux users need to have one of the following clipboard utilities installed for copy/paste functionality to work:

**For X11 systems:**

```bash
apt install -y xclip
# or
apt install -y xsel
```

**For Wayland systems:**

```bash
apt install -y wl-clipboard
```

**For headless environments:**

```bash
apt install -y xvfb
# and run:
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
export DISPLAY=:99.0
```

opencode will detect if you're using Wayland and prefer `wl-clipboard`, otherwise it will try to find clipboard tools in order of: `xclip` and `xsel`.

### TUI not rendering full width

By default, opencode's TUI uses an "auto" layout that centers content with padding. If you want the TUI to use the full width of your terminal, you can configure the layout setting:

```json
{
  "layout": "stretch"
}
```

Add this to your `opencode.json` configuration file. The available layout options are:

- `"auto"` (default) - Centers content with padding
- `"stretch"` - Uses full terminal width
