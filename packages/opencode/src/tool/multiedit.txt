This is a tool for making multiple edits to a single file in one operation. It is built on top of the Edit tool and allows you to perform multiple find-and-replace operations efficiently. Prefer this tool over the Edit tool when you need to make multiple edits to the same file.

Before using this tool:

1. Use the Read tool to understand the file's contents and context
2. Verify the directory path is correct

To make multiple file edits, provide the following:
1. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)
2. edits: An array of edit operations to perform, where each edit contains:
   - oldString: The text to replace (must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)
   - newString: The edited text to replace the oldString
   - replaceAll: Replace all occurrences of oldString. This parameter is optional and defaults to false.

IMPORTANT:
- All edits are applied in sequence, in the order they are provided
- Each edit operates on the result of the previous edit
- All edits must be valid for the operation to succeed - if any edit fails, none will be applied
- This tool is ideal when you need to make several changes to different parts of the same file

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. All edits follow the same requirements as the single Edit tool
2. The edits are atomic - either all succeed or none are applied
3. Plan your edits carefully to avoid conflicts between sequential operations

WARNING:
- The tool will fail if edits.oldString doesn't match the file contents exactly (including whitespace)
- The tool will fail if edits.oldString and edits.newString are the same
- Since edits are applied in sequence, ensure that earlier edits don't affect the text that later edits are trying to find

When making edits:
- Ensure all edits result in idiomatic, correct code
- Do not leave the code in a broken state
- Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- Use replaceAll for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.

If you want to create a new file, use:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- First edit: empty oldString and the new file's contents as newString
- Subsequent edits: normal edit operations on the created content
